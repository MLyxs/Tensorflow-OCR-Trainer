**OCR Trainer**

A trainer that uses flask Web UI and Tensorflow's Estimator for ease of training models.

You can upload your own dataset. The dataset should contain the following:

- Images
- The labels file containing at least the names of the images (without extension), and their corresponding labels.

You can also build your own network architectures there and view them too. 

With just a dataset, and a network architecture, you can start training your own models! After training them, you can test them too.
